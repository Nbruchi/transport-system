Rwanda is a country with the capital city Kigali and six designated secondary cities: Huye, Muhanga, Musanze, Nyagatare, Rubavu and Rusizi

In the transport sector, the Ministry of Infrastructure(Rwanda) is focused on constructing and maintaining roads that connect the secondary cities to the capital city. While some roads are already in place, others are planned for future development. Below is a list of cities both existing roads and those scheduled for construction, along with their estimated budgets in Rwandan francs (RWF)

1. Kigali - Muhanga (RWF 28.6 Billion)
2. Kigali - Musanze (RWF 28.6 Billion)
3. Kigali - Nyagatare (RWF 70.84 Billion)
4. Muhanga - Huye (RWF 56.7 Billion)
5. Musanze - Rubavu (RWF 33.7 Billion)
6. Huye - Rusizi (RWF 80.96 Billion)
7. Muhanga - Rusizi (RWF 117.5 Billion)
8. Musanze - Nyagatare (RWF 96.14 Billion)
9. Muhanga - Musanze (RWF 66.3 Billion)

Each city is assigned a numerical identifier as follows:
_ Kigali (1)
_ Huye (2)
_ Muhanga (3)
_ Musanze (4)
_ Nyagatare (5)
_ Rubavu (6)
_ Rusizi (7)

As the country continues to develop, the government plans to designate additional secondary cities. Each newly added city will receive the next available index number behind Rusizi.
